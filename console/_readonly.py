"""Read-only console support: deny-list + improvement-suggestion capture.

The MCP console spawns a ``claude`` subprocess with every file-mutation tool
denied (``DISALLOWED_TOOLS``), so the agent CANNOT edit the repo (a console
agent once rewrote a server's own source mid-session). The self-improving RAG
is unaffected: ``learn_pattern`` is an MCP tool, so its writes happen in the
MCP server process, not via the agent's file tools.

Instead of editing code, the agent is instructed to surface code-improvement
ideas as ``@@SUGGESTION@@ <text>`` lines. ``capture_suggestions`` — the ONLY
writer of the backlog file — pulls those lines out of the reply, appends them
(timestamped, with a one-time header) for a later dev session / PR, and strips
the markers from what the user sees.

Pure stdlib (no Qt / no Maya deps) so it is unit-testable outside the host app.
